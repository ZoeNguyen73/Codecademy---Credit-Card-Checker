# Credit Card Checker project
## About the project
This is a challenge project which is part of Full-Stack Engineering path at Codecademy.

Project goal: Create a code that helps to identify invalid Credit Card numbers.

Language: JavaScript


## Detailed requirements (main)
* Create a function, **validateCred()** that has a parameter of an array. The purpose of validateCred() is to return *true* when an array contains digits of a valid credit card number and *false* when it is invalid.

* Create another function, __findInvalidCards()__ that has one parameter for a nested array of credit card numbers. The role of findInvalidCards() is to check through the nested array for which numbers are invalid, and return another nested array of invalid cards.

*Create a function, __idInvalidCardCompanies()__ that has one parameter for a nested array of invalid numbers and returns an array of companies.


## Additional tasks
* Create a function that accepts a string and converts it into an array of numbers like the initially provided arrays.

* Create a function that will convert invalid numbers into valid numbers.
